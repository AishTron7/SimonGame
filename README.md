# Simon Game
Simon is a classic game of memory skill originally invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, with software programming by Lenny Cope. A series of tones and lights are produced and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.

I built this game to practice my logical abilities while I'm learning javascript. The back-end is written in javascript, while the front-end uses simple html and css.
